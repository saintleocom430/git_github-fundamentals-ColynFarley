# 1. I have previously never used github so the learning curve has been immense.
## 2 .For example the creating pull requests, creating README files, and messing with the user dashboard. 
### 3. I am still confused about the pull request however as it would not allow me to create. I searched online and still could not figure it out.
I look forward to learning more about this system.
